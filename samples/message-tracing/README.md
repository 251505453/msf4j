# Message tracing in MSF4J
Message tracing in the context of microservices refers to the ability to trace & visualize how a call from a client
resulted in one or more calls to services.

These tracing sample demonstrate message tracing in action using frameworks such as 
[WSO2 Data Analytics Server (DAS)](http://wso2.com/products/data-analytics-server/)
& [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/).

Take a look at the following samples:

* [Feign client based tracing with DAS](das/feign-client)
* [JAXRS client based tracing with DAS](das/jaxrs-client)
* [JAXRS client based tracing with Zipkin](zipkin/jaxrs-client)
